# Invisible_Cloak

Language: Python3.8

IDE used: Spyder andaconda

Library used: OpenCv/cv2 and numpy

Made Harry Potter Invisble cloak with python 3.8 and opencv. First we captured the background image with 'background.py' file and saved it in the same directory then the main code is in 'app.py'. used hsv instead of rgb. image processing not dont that good edge corrections needed(mainly because of laptop webcam quality) thants why I used 'DroidCam' app to use my mobile camera as webcam. Thats the reason I used VideoCapture value 1 instead of 0.

If you use your laptop for image capture and as wll as webcam for input then change the VideoCapture value to 0.
